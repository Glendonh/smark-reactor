We watch wrestling for very different reasons. We don't all get the same things out of it. Often, the aspects of wrestling that some of us love the most are the aspects that other segments of the fanbase despise. Whenever some new devise segment comes along, the debates start all over again. Whether it's:  
[a match full of acrobatics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN2IrUeULZw)  
[a cinematic segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jzScgAhSt0)  
 or [stepping outside of kayfabe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vkn8XgWxJdA)  
 rest assured that wrestling fans will have very strong opinions about it.

 Frankly, that's what makes wrestling so interesting. It's so many different things to so many different people. Where problems arise is when fans decide that the way other people enjoy the product is wrong. Online discussions of wrestling are full of people finding ways to denigrate those who enjoy a kind of wrestling they don't. Fans who aren't a fan of high paced matches with lots of high spots tend to denigrate the ones who do by talking about "moves" and "muh workrate." It's perfectly fine to hate a match like Ospreay vs Ricochet, but if you feel a need to insult the intelligence of anyone who enjoyed it, odds are high that you're an insecure asshole.

I'm highly opinionated, and I'm not a relentlessly positive person. I think there are lots of things in wrestling that I think suck, and I plan to write about why I think they suck. However, if you enjoy the things I hate, I don't think you're wrong. In fact, I'm happy that you enjoyed those segments I hated. I might wish that there were fewer segments in wrestling that you enjoy, but I'm still glad that you enjoyed the ones you did.

Ultimately it would be unreasonable to expect wrestling fan to all agree on anything. It would be equally unreasonable to tell any segment of the fan base that they shouldn't complain about the parts of wrestling that they hate. What we should all try to do a little less of, however, is running down the people that enjoy the things you don't. Their fun is not wrong.
