I have some advice for you, fellow wrestling fan. Stop watching bad wrestling. I’m not here to tell you which wrestling shows are bad. You have to figure that out for yourself. What I’m saying is, that you should stop watching wrestling that you’re not enjoying. Trust me, you’ll be a lot happier if you do.

Maybe you love the brands you’re watching right now. That’s awesome. I’m not here to tell you that [your fun is wrong](../your-fun-is-not-wrong). On the other hand, maybe you aren’t loving the product you’re spending several hours a week on. Maybe you’re watching it out of habit. Maybe you’re waiting for it to turn around. If that sounds like you, then I highly recommend that you explore your options.

There is a truly staggering amount of wrestling available now. There’s wrestling on YouTube, there’s wrestling on Twitch. There are more promotions with their own streaming service than I can count. There are streaming services with multiple promotions, like Highspots, IndependentWrestling.tv and WWN. It’s quick and easy to find wrestling from the US, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Japan.

If you love wrestling, then you should be watching wreslting that you love. No matter what it is that you love about wrestling, you can almost certainly find it somewhere. There are promotions doing every style of wrestling imaginable. Go out there and find your new favorite thing in wrestling
