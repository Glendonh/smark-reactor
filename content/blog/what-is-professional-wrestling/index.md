It's surpringly hard to talk about professional wrestling. That's not because of some kind of stigma, or any social taboos. The reason it's so hard to talk about wrestling is that no one can agree on what the hell it is.

There is nothing else quite like pro wrestling, and the result is that it defies categorization. Is it a sport? Is it a television drama? [A magic show?](https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2019/3/9/18258060/ronda-rousey-message-wwe-fans-wrestlers-youre-a-mark-loll) No comparison is a perfect fit, and which one is the best is a subject of much debate among fans and even industry insiders.

When wrestling deviates from the most well established formulas, it typically results in a great deal of arguing in the community. The way that fans and insiders argue about things like [worked shoots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo8x8N6cL1Y), [fantastical dramatic segments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YBkmPuS4EM), and [comedy spots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCtgGfI-MaQ) tends to reveal that we consume these shows in radically different ways.

Is it important to fool wrestling fans in this day and age? Fans of the worked shoot certainly think so. On the other side of the fence are the people who think that a worked shoot makes the rest of the show feel meaningless.

Some fans love clearly fictional segments like Allie visiting the undead realm. For others, it shreds the suspension of disbelief. When Jim Cornette was asked to review an episode of Lucha Underground, his primary takeaway was "that's not wrestling."

Ultimately, fans consume wrestling in very different ways. This means there's no consenus about what exactly professional wreslting is. When fans argue the merits of segments that deviate from the norm, they often aren't even having the same conversation.

What professional wrestling is, what it isn't, and what it should be are topcis that the fanbase will probably never have consensus on. They're also some of the topics I find the most interesting, and the kind of content I hope to explore in this blog.
